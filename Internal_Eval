Internal Evaluation
===================
This document will be an evaluation of our design decisions.



Evidently, our design makes use of several essential design principles for simplicity and efficiency.  Our design makes use of a hierarchical structure to make the system easier to build and test.  We made use of abstraction by having the program abstract the whole game, the game abstract the board, the board abstract the pieces, etc. so we could start assigning different parts to the group right away.  For this reason, we also used the idea of information hiding to make things that are likely to change private.  This maximized efficiency and allowed us to get our design done very quickly.  Our design makes use of the high cohesion and low coupling principles as much as possible to make sure our modules are meaningful when standing alone.
